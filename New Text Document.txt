ps- With the rise of AI-generated content, deepfake videos and fake news are spreading rapidly, making it hard to distinguish real from manipulated media. This project aims to provide a reliable, AI-powered tool that detects such content, helping users verify authenticity and fight misinformation.



Pitch Flow

1. Hook (Problem Statement – 20–30 sec)
"Every day, millions of videos and news articles circulate online, and many of them are manipulated or fake. It’s becoming increasingly difficult for people to know what’s real. Deepfakes and fake news aren’t just misleading—they can be dangerous."

2. Introduce Your Solution (30–40 sec)
"Our project is a web platform that detects deepfake videos and verifies news articles in real-time. Users can upload a video or paste a news article, and our AI-powered system analyzes it, providing a confidence score, visual highlights, and explanations."

3. Explain Innovation / USP (20–30 sec)
"What sets us apart is that we combine both deepfake and fake news detection in one platform. It’s fast, user-friendly, works on desktop and mobile, and doesn’t just give a yes/no answer—it shows why content is suspicious, making it easy to understand and trust."

4. Demonstration (Optional, 30–60 sec)

Show the UI

Upload a sample video → show deepfake detection results

Paste a news snippet → show fake news detection results

Highlight the confidence scores and visual explanations

5. Future Scope / Vision (20–30 sec)
"In the future, we aim to expand to real-time streaming detection, browser and mobile apps, multilingual support, and advanced visual reports for journalists, educators, and everyday users."

6. Closing (10–15 sec)
